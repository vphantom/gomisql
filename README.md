# SQL Good Migrations (gomisql)

[![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/vphantom/gomisql.svg?style=plastic)]() [![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/vphantom/gomisql.svg?style=plastic)]()

Tiny stand-alone database upgrade/downgrade manager with dependency support.

- Single file, runs on any POSIX shell (sh, ash, dash, ksh, bash...)
- Compatible with stdin-friendly backends (MySQL/MariaDB, SQLite3, PostgreSQL...)
- Each migration is a single SQL file
- No need for numeric versioning: each migration is named arbitrarily
- Migrations can depend on other migrations
- Migrations are verified for success
- Migrations can be reverted


## Why Another SQL Migration Manager?

I wanted a migration tool similar in functionality to the excellent https://sqitch.org/ but without the run-time dependencies on Perl and a lot of modules.  I looked into https://github.com/mbucc/shmig which is a shell script, but doesn't support dependencies between migrations themselves.  I ended up "rolling my own" and gomiSQL was born.


## Installation & Usage

Just download the stand-alone `gomisql` shell script and make it executable. ;-)

### Options

- `-h` Display help
- `-d` Display all executed SQL and back-end output
- `-p <path>` Location of the SQL files [default: `./migrations/`]
- `-b <cmd>` Name of back-end command [default: `mysql`]
- `-a <args>` Arguments to pass to back-end command [default: `--batch`]

Several environment variables can also be used, although command line options have priority:

- `GOMISQL_DEBUG` (set non-empty to enable)
- `GOMISQL_PATH`
- `GOMISQL_BACKEND`
- `GOMISQL_ARGS`

#### SQLite3 Example

```sh
gomisql -b sqlite3 -a testdb.sqlite list
```

#### MySQL Example

```sh
# Assuming you are configured for non-interactive authentication
gomisql -a "--user someuser somedb" list
```

#### PostgreSQL Example

```sh
gomisql -b psql -a "-d somedb -h somehost -U someuser" list
```

### Commands

#### `gomisql [opts] list`

Run all validations to discover which are and aren't deployed.

#### `gomisql [opts] create <name>`

Create empty migration `name` from handy template.

#### `gomisql [opts] deploy [<name>]`

Deploy migration `name` and dependencies, or all avaliable if not specified.

#### `gomisql [opts] revert <name>`

Revert migration `name`.  Aborts if any deployed migration depends on `name`, displaying which.

## Migration Files

A migration file is a standard SQL file with special comments.  Standard multiline `/* ... */` comments are ignored.  Single-line `-- ` comments are considered to be the start of a new section, so they cannot be used inside of a section.

### `-- #Dependencies: ...`

Optional.  Explicitly name other migration file basenames (without the `.sql` extension) which must be deployed and valid before attempting to deploy this one.

### `-- #Deploy:`

Mandatory.  Begins SQL code to run when deploying the migration.  Ends at the next single-line comment.

### `-- #Verify:`

Mandatory.  Begins SQL code to run to prove that a migration was successfully deployed.  Ends at the next single-line comment.  Verifications are run after deployments and whenever dependencies need checking.  **CAUTION:** While you may technically omit this section, doing so means the migration is considered to be already deployed and is thus not deployable!

To test whether a table or some columns exist, just select them with a false condition, as the SQL back-end will fail and let us know:

```sql
BEGIN;
/* Prove that foo.col1, foo.col2 and foo.col3 exist in schema. */
SELECT col1, col2, col3 FROM foo WHERE 0;
ROLLBACK;
```

To test whether a specific row exists, make the back-end output `#FAIL` which will be recognized as a failure.  Forcing the presence of results with `COUNT(*)` does the trick, along with `COALESCE()`.  Be sure to use one distinct `SELECT` per row to check, so that any missing row causes a failure.

```sql
BEGIN;
/* Output '#FAIL' if user 23 does not exist. */
SELECT COALESCE(id, '#FAIL', COUNT(*)) AS id FROM users WHERE id='23';
ROLLBACK;
```

### `-- #Revert:`

Optional.  Begins SQL code to run to revert the migration.  Ends at the next single-line comment.

### Example

Given the following files:

```text
./migrations/foo.sql
./migrations/bar.sql
./migrations/baz.sql
```

...and `./migrations/baz.sql` containing the following:

```sql
-- #Dependencies: foo bar

This is ignored!

-- #Deploy:

BEGIN;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
    `id` INTEGER UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    `name` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
COMMIT;

-- #Verify:

BEGIN;
SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE 0;
ROLLBACK;

-- #Revert:

BEGIN;
DROP TABLE users;
COMMIT;

-- This is ignored

This is ignored
```

Running the following would cause migrations foo and bar, then baz to be installed if missing:

```sh
gomisql -y -a "--batch --user dbuser" deploy baz
```

## FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

Dependencies are installed outright during deployment; it would be better if a list was displayed and the user was asked to accept, along with a `-y` option to assume "yes" (like `apt-get`).

Similarly, instead of aborting when a reversion is impossible, it would be better to display the list of migrations which would need to be reverted and prompt for approval.

Both the above imply maintaining a list of migrations to be deployed or removed in memory instead of doing it as we go, which while feasible isn't an absolute necessity for now.
